## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Features

- **Farmer Page**: Farmers can add their products with details including name, price, quantity, image URL, description, and category (vegetables, fruits, others).
- **Buyer Page**: Buyers can view available products, categorized for easy browsing, and add them to their cart.

- **User Authentication**: Login and registration functionality to manage user sessions.

## Technologies Used
